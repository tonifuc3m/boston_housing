# kaggle_iowa_housing

This is an exploration of the Kaggle Iowa House Prices datasets. 

The main code is an R Markdown.

I will perform a basic exploratory analysis, pre-processing, variable selection and train several models. 

In addition, I will show how to do hyper-parameter tuning with R package caret and XGBoost.

Finally, also code for parallel programming in Windows with R is provided.
