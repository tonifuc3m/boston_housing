# kaggle-iowa-housing

This is an exploration of the Kaggle Iowa House Prices datasets. 

Notes:

+ The main code is an R Markdown (.rmd). However, to explore the notebook online, use the .md file.

+ R version: 3.5.1.

+ Packages needed: c("data.table", "dplyr", "tidyr", "stringr" ,"pracma", "skimr", "ggplot2", "caret", "glmnet", "doParallel", "xgboost").

Steps: 

1. I will perform a basic exploratory analysis, pre-processing, variable selection and train several models. 

2. In addition, I will show how to do hyper-parameter tuning with R package caret and XGBoost.

3. Finally, also code for parallel programming in Windows with R is provided.
